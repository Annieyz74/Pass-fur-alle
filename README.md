# Pass f√ºr alle

Since Polisens web queueing solution for getting a passport sucks, and it is more or less impossible to book a time, I wrote this small python script. What it does is that it automates the searching for a bookable time. In the file you just change the constants to your information and away you go. :) More or less.

### Terminal
If you don't know what a terminal is; think of it as the thing you see on the news when something has been hacked, and there's a picture of someone in a hoodie is leaning over a computer? Or that time you saw Wargames, The Matrix, Mr Robot or even Hackers? That's the terminal.
To find *Terminal*, open *Launchpad* and the folder *Other* and there it is. Or open *Spotlight* and type *Terminal*.
